# Ticker Ticks

TickerTicks is a Python app that helps in fetching the data for any Index, Equity, or any other instrument from either NSE or BSE using the Zerodha Kite's API. It can take any ticker along with the date and time range and fetch the historical data for the same for the given time-frame.

This code fetches the data for the 15-minute timeframe, although you can tweak it to fetch the data for any other time-frame as you need.

```
$ py fetch_data.py
```
